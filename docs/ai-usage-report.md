# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used & Use Cases

### ChatGPT

ChatGPT was used throughout the development process for:

- Reducing redundant code in repeated project cards.
- Improving the dark/light theme implementation (changing from a simple button to a toggle switch).
- Debugging and refining JavaScript logic for theme persistence using localStorage.
- Enhancing UI design decisions such as:
  - Making the navbar slightly transparent with backdrop blur.
  - Applying the 60/30/10 color rule for visual balance.
  - Improving spacing and layout alignment.
- Reviewing and improving code readability and structure.
- Assisting with documentation writing.

## Benefits of Using AI

- Faster debugging and issue resolution.
- Improved UI/UX decisions based on best practices.
- Cleaner and more structured CSS organization.
- Better understanding of responsive design and layout hierarchy.
- Improved theme toggle implementation logic.

---

## Challenges & Limitations

- Some AI-generated suggestions initially included redundant styles.
- Responsive media query structure required manual correction.
- Some UI improvements needed refinement to match the assignment scope.
- Not all suggestions were directly usable without modification.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained deeper understanding of CSS architecture and variable-based theming.
- Learned how the 60/30/10 design principle applies to UI development.
- Improved understanding of JavaScript event handling and class toggling.
- Learned how localStorage maintains persistent user preferences.
- Developed stronger skills in reviewing and refining AI-generated code.

## Responsible Use & Modifications

All AI-generated suggestions were carefully reviewed and tested before being included.

- Redundant or unnecessary code was removed.
- Layout and responsiveness were manually verified using DevTools.
- JavaScript logic was adjusted to ensure correctness.
- The final structure reflects personal understanding and manual refinement.

The final submission represents my own understanding and adaptation of AI-assisted suggestions.
